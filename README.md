# Hi there 👋🏼

## I'm Anindya

I'm a final year undergraduate pursuing BTech in Information Technology from a public engineering institution in India. I'm 22 years old. I am a tech enthusiast and actively remain on the watch for new tech products. I like learning about how things work and am fascinated about how computers work.

### ⚡ Fun facts

I grew up taking things apart, starting with toys, and later moved on to computers, laptops, phones, etc. By the age of 10, I got bored of cartoons and started watching shows like *How it's Made* and *Mega Factories* on *Discovery* and *National Geographic*. I picked up *3D modelling* at 13, and that has been one of my favourite pastimes.

### 🌱 My interests are ...

I've always been interested in building new things, hence my interest in ***3D***. I started exploring software development, back in 2016, after finishing high school. I started with *Android*, and made a couple simple applications. I, however, quickly moved to ***Web Development***, as I found the entry tax to be lower and it was cross-platform. I was hovering a lot, trying to find what my interests actually were. Of late, I figured I'm interested in ***Interactive Multimedia***, and recently started reading a book titled *"About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design"*. By the way, I love board games.

### 🔭 I’m currently ...

I'm building ***Music Blocks 2***, which is based on [*Music Blocks*](https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org) — a visual programming language used to create music. The goal is to take on the challenges encountered due to the original architecture, and build a more robust and reliable application, from the ground up. I also have plans to undertake the development of a ***Physics World*** simulating *Dynamics*, to aid high school students.

### 🛠 I use ...

I am comfortable programming in `JavaScript` (plus `TypeScript`) and `Java`. I've been exploring ***Creative Coding*** for a while to inspire and educate myself for my venture. I've been using `Processing`, `p5.js`, `matter.js`, and `liquidfun` for some fun experiments.
