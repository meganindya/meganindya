# Hi there üëãüèº

## I'm Anindya

I'm a software engineer and have an undergraduate degree in Information Technology. I'm 24 years old. I am a tech enthusiast and actively remain on the watch for new tech products. I like _learning about how things work_ and am _fascinated about how computers work_.

### ‚ö° Fun facts

I grew up taking things apart, starting with toys, and later moved on to computers, laptops, phones, etc. By the age of 10, I got bored of cartoons and started watching shows like _How it's Made_ and _Mega Factories_ on _Discovery_ and _National Geographic_. I picked up _3D modelling_ at 13, and that has been one of my favourite pastimes.

### üå± Interests

I'm interested in _**Interactive Multimedia**_, _**Creative Coding**_, and _**Visual and Abstract Programming**_. I've recently started reading a book titled _"About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design"_. By the way, I love board games.

### üî≠ Working on ...

I'm leading the effort in building [_**Music Blocks (v4)**_](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4), which is based on [_Music Blocks_](https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org) ‚Äî a _visual programming language_ platform that aims to engage children in the arts, mathematics, and computation. The goal is to address the challenges encountered due to the original architecture, and build a more robust and reliable application, from the ground up. I also have plans to undertake the development of a _**Physics World**_ simulating _Dynamics_, to aid high school students.

### üìö Learning ...

Lately, I've been inquisitive about architecture of software and systems. I'm reading a book titled _"Linux Kernel Development"_ by _Robert Love_. I want to dive into embedded systems programming sometime.

### üõ† Technical Proficiency

My primary interest is in full-stack _**Web Development**_, and I've been writing web stack code for the last 5 years. I particularly love working on building interactive apps that people can engage with.

- I prefer using `TypeScript` over `JavaScript`.
- I prefer `Dockerized` apps and have experience with `docker-compose` and some `Kubernetes`.
- I've recently been exploring `Rust` and `Web Assembly`.
- I have a knack for well-documented, clean, and practical code.
